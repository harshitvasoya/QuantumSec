# Cybersecurity Portfolio Web Application

This is a simple React-based web application for a cybersecurity portfolio. It showcases various sections like Home, About Me, Projects, Blog, Future Scope, and Contact.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository (or create the files manually as provided):**
    If you're getting these files as a package, create a new folder (e.g., `my-cyber-portfolio`) and place all the extracted contents inside it.

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd my-cyber-portfolio
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn install
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or if you use yarn
    # yarn start
    ```

    This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port).
